# Howdy, David here ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŒ

Pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science Aerospace at the University of Toronto, with a minor in Machine Intelligence.

Outgoing individual, driven to make a meaningful impact in humanityâ€™s pursuit of the stars through technological innovation and engineering. I revel in facing real-world, open-ended challenges, and I am always ready to dive into uncharted territories. I excel at tackling ill-posed problems through novel solutions and I am not afraid to fail-forward. I adopt a continuous growth mindset and hold technical mastery in high regard. I often question the status quo and fall back to the fundamentals of the natural world from first principles. Never afraid to take the driver's seat as an expressive-driver leader, I love to learn and quickly grasp new concepts as they arise in my work. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional team settings and when working with individuals of equal passion and dedication. I value efficiency, modularity, sustainability, and aesthetics in my design work.
